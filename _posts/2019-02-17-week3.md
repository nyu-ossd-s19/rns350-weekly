WEEK 3
------

This week was a lot of fun, and I was super happy to have things to showcase on monday.  Our third group member completed the scripts and our project was good and ready to go! To be completely honest, though, communication was not great, which obviously shows due to the lack of understanding about who was doing what, and my experience last week with accidently recreating work that someone else had done. I think that the project would have been tremendously easier if we had all communicated more.  We did little collaboration outside of the classroom and it was definately a detrement to getting our work done efficiently and effectively.  Since community is so important to open source, it's even more dissappointing that we did not experience that to the level that we could have. This experience has taught me the value of inter group communication and I look forward to improving my workflow into the upcoming weeks.
