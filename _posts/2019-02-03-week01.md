  When I hear the term open source, the immediate thought that comes to my mind is collaboration.  There is no other realm in computer science that I have entered that is as community based as open source is, and one would be hard pressed to find any realm outside of computer science that can provide the same ease of entry and worldwide impact. (which is also a funny coincidence considering how anti-social coders tend to be).  
  Even more than a defining feature, however, the collaborative nature of open source is actually one of it's greatest advantages.  When working with a closed team, it can be very easy to get into a pattern of thought, where the same ideas are recycled and revamped multiple times.  In many situations, this is fantastic, as it leads to a refinement and polish of the original ideas brought into the project.  However, as any coder knows (or pretends not to know), the development process can be long, arduous, and riddled with problems that were not originally taken into account or prepared for.
