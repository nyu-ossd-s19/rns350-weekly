FreeCodeCamp and Me
-------------------

Over the past month or so, me and my group have been hard at work on freeCodeCamp.  From the beginning, I took up the recursion challenge for our group, and spent the time learning Chai Assert so that we could create a challenge and create the tests.  Besides this, I have also done a lot of check work for the group, as the local running of the application is extremely finicky and I am the person in the group who has managed to get the local runtime working most consistently.  That being said, it still fails a lot, and I find myself restarting my computer multiple times and running the same commands until it decides to run.  This greatly slowed down my ability to create and test the coding challenge as I have spent chunks of time sometimes an hour long just to get th local machine running so that I can check if the tests I've written work.  Other than the recursion challenge, I tested and debugged the solutions that my group members wrote for the sorting algorithms through the local machine, and mae sure they worked before the PR.  It's been a good semester, and I'm happy with the work I've done.  I'm hoping to take more coding challenges after the class ended since I've taken the time to learn Chai assert.
