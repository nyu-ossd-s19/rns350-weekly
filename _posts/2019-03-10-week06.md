HFOSS
-----

I had a great experience this week learning about humanitarian open source software this week.  Seriously, it's a new and incredible way to get involved with helping others to me.  As someone who has always been big about doing things for the greater good, this is incredibly exciting to me.  For these reasons, I think it would be very easy for me to get involved with HFOSS.  However, over all, I think these kinds of projects would be tougher to get heavily involved with, as they require a much higher degree of accuracy and reliability.  I would be incredibly nervous trying to fix bugs in code such as that; however, the prospect of being able to help others greatly outweighs that risk of responsibility, and would just mean that I am much more careful writing and testing my code.

Besides the personal feeling of accomplishment in helping others, I would imagine that these kinds of projects could bring a great amount of prestige to the maintainers, as maintaining a project like this would take an incredible amount of planning, managing, and bug testing.  The extreme measures that the individuals who run these projects must go through in order to bring these projects to areas in need in time would go to show how experienced of a leader that these maintainers must be.  I have a great deal of respect for people that take up that mantle, and would be proud to work along someone like this.  With all of these points in mind, I would love to have the opportunity to work in a HFOSS project.
