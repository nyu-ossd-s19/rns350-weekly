WEEK 4
------

Hello everyone!  Exciting news this week - I've done some research into a potential open source project to get involved with, and it seems really cool!  It's called freeCodeCamp and it's an online tool for adults to learn code and get involved with tech.  As someone who has always loved to learn and teach, I figured it could be a perfect project for me to get involved in.  In the following section, I'll add some information I discovered during my research!
