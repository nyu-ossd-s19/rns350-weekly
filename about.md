 I came to this decision after bouncing between psychology, English, and Computer Science for a year, eventually finding that I really enjoyed coding.  While I did decide on computer science, i still have a strong love for psychology, and have completed a minor in it.  I liked psychology because it was an avenue for me to help others, and now with open source, I have another opportunity to do so.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music, and can play trumpet, guitar, ukelele, and some piano.
I am a fluent English speaker and an intermediate level Japanese speaker.
I also love to write, and would be content with a career in creative writing.
