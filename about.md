I am A junior at NYU pursuing a degree in computer science. I came to the decision to study computer science after bouncing between psychology, English, and Computer Science for a year, eventually finding that I really enjoyed coding.  While I did decide on computer science, i still have a strong love for psychology, and have completed a minor in it.  I liked psychology because it was an avenue for me to help others, and now with open source, I have another opportunity to do so.

I also love to write, and would be content with a career in creative writing.
